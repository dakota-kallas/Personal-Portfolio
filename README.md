## Description
**_Portfolio Website to Showcase my Skills_** <br/>
This project is a personal portfolio site used to showcase my skills & projects. I published it using GitHub Pages and Google Domains. The portfolio website contains two main pages: A home page and a projects page.  An important feature in this project is responsiveness to different screen sizes, and can be viewed on both mobile devices and desktop computers. Future updates on the project will include dark mode aw well as new personal projects added to the "projects" page.
